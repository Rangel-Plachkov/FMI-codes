# CS Study Repository

This repository contains all the code written during my Computer Science study at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI).

## Overview

Throughout my time at FMI, I've worked on various projects, assignments, and exercises covering a wide range of topics in computer science. This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of all the code I've written during my studies.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories based on the courses and topics covered during my CS study. Each directory contains code related to a specific subject area or project. Below is a brief overview of the directory structure:

- **Algorithms_and_Data_Structures**: Implementations of various algorithms and data structures studied during courses such as Introduction to Algorithms, Data Structures, and Algorithm Design.
  
- **Programming_Languages**: Code written in different programming languages studied at FMI, including Java, Python, C/C++, and others.
  
- **Databases**: Database-related projects and exercises covering topics like SQL, relational databases, and database management systems.
  
- **Web_Development**: Web development projects, assignments, and exercises focusing on frontend, backend, and full-stack development.
  
- **Networking**: Code related to computer networking, including socket programming, network protocols, and network simulation.
  
- **Software_Engineering**: Projects and assignments related to software engineering principles, software design, testing, and documentation.

Each directory may contain subdirectories for specific projects or assignments, along with README files providing additional information about the contents.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and use the code for reference or educational purposes. You may find implementations of algorithms, examples of programming language features, and solutions to various problems encountered during my CS study.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while this repository contains code written by me during my CS study, it may not represent the most optimal or up-to-date solutions. Code quality and style may vary depending on the stage of my learning and the specific requirements of assignments.
